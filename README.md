# Replication Project – Panel Data Econometrics  

This repository contains code and data for my replication project in the **Panel Data Econometrics** course. The project replicates the findings of *"From Extreme to Mainstream: The Erosion of Social Norms"* by Bursztyn et al. (2020). Additionally, I extend the analysis by applying the **wild cluster bootstrap** to assess the robustness of the results.  

## Files  
- **Table 2.R** – Code for replicating Table 2 from the original paper.  
- **Waves.R** – Analysis of different experimental waves.  
- **Wild cluster.R** – Implementation of the wild cluster bootstrap method.
